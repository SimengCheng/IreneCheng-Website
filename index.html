        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, I am Irene Cheng. I am a first-year student studying economics at the University of California Riverside. I immigrated from China, so I can speak both Chinese and English. I transferred here during my second semester of 10th grade high school. It was not easy for me to get into a new environment where people come from all over the world, speak different languages, and have different cultures. I got so many people asking why do you choose to come here and how does it feel like to be in the United States. To be honest, the reason I choose the United States is based on my parents’ decision. They wish I can receive a better education and they also want to invest here. However, I think it is a nice choice to live here and the environment here fits me better. I prefer to study individually and voluntarily. I don’t like the idea that your grade determines all the results. I love to be creative rather than be stricted and there is only one answer for a question. I love to collaborate with others on a project rather than only watch a teacher's demonstration. China's educational resources are still poor by world standards. Although universities continue to expand enrollment, it will take a long time for faculty and facilities to catch up. The rich educational resources of the United States can be used for our purposes. Moreover, the educational methods, concepts and teaching facilities of developed countries are more advanced than those of China. American universities offer a wide range of majors, many of which are not available in China, or their equivalent majors are not widely recognized abroad, typically including clinical medicine and law. If I want to practice in the United States, then you have to choose to get an American degree. Second, in China, the majority of applicants for postgraduate study still require a bachelor's degree background in the same major, while studying abroad for master's degree is more flexible, there is no need for academic examination, and it is more convenient to change majors. I have lots of hobbies. I played piano for 10 years and I received the certificate from both ABRSM and the Music Teachers' Association of California. I love listening to music and I love dancing. I am learning economics right now but I am now considering changing my major or taking a minor. The reason why I want to change my major is that economics is more liberal arts and I have studied more general business. However, I prefer to directly learn business content, learn how to process and analyze data. I might probably choose accounting or computer science for my minor. Because society is stepping into the era of big data, if you want to become more competitive, learning how to deal with data will be more advantageous. In the meantime, I'm learning python on Coursera. So far I've only got an entry-level certificate. I know how to use google docs, google slide, google sheets and so on. I can also edita videos or draw on an ipad.

        Learning is the student's occupation, this occupation also needs to have wisdom, perseverance, and perseverance. I think the primary task of college students is to learn English well. So I am steady in my study. It's not relaxing at all. I think good learning methods are very helpful to learn knowledge, so after every exam, I would summarize my learning experience. No pains, no gains, often see their gratifying achievements, I will sigh only if you have determination, nothing is impossible. At the same time, I also understand the truth about one "There are mountains to the west and people to the west. Satisfied with the status quo, you should always push yourself to forge ahead, constantly learn new knowledge, and not be complacent. For our safety engineering specialist for students, it is far from enough to learn knowledge from books. When I had a vacation to the engineering field practice, let me more have a deep understanding of my major. During the practice, I learned a lot of knowledge that I did not have in books, which made me more interested in this major keen interest. It also helps to improve my own potential. It exercises my full potential and makes me more confident in myself. I learned a few things from my first quarter at UCR, although I took online classes they did not require me to take attendance, it is better for me to not miss any lecture classes. I should not trust myself, because I will always give up to watch those online materials, and the result is that I cannot finish my class in a limited time. When I lost too much, I cannot understand the materials after that. The other point is that when you have any questions, find your professor and ask them. They are pleased to help you and you will get sincere help from them. When I write my first essay in my English class, as a result of did not ask for help, my first essay completely shift the topic, so I am planning to give my second essay to my professor and ask for help.  Mentally, I went through a big transition. High school is to prepare for the college entrance examination, and enter the university, into a free, no constrained world, with no one to manage you, you must have a high degree of self-restraint, self-discipline, self-study, and introspection. I've been undisciplined since the beginning from a gradual transition to self-discipline, and self-study. Correct attitude in the mind, establish life goals, learning goals. The college campus is a big family. In this big family, we play the role of the subject of cultivation. Teachers are our elders, So I have a lot of respect for them. The students are like brothers and sisters, we study together, entertain together, help each other, and get along harmoniously. Living in public has taught me to take the initiative to understand and care for others. It has also made me stronger and more independent. Be responsible for yourself, others can only give you a few recommendations. Meet things to think calmly, and don't be impatient. Life needs to be drawn by themselves, not the same way there is a different life.

        I'm currently working in the cafeteria of UCR. It's usually a DRO dishroom. During the summer vacation before I went to college, I worked in a milk tea shop. Although very tired, I cherish this period of working time. I feel that my spoken English has improved and I have learned how to solve the questions that guests will ask. For example, if the order of milk tea is wrong, I will first express my apologies and then make a new cup for the customer according to the company's policy. I also learn to be responsible. A part-time job lets me practice my language ability. We are always around people we know at school or at home. We speak casually and directly. But if we want to step into society, such language expression is not enough. Part-time jobs let us properly contact and adapt to society. A part-time job also allows me to exercise my courage. No matter what you do, take the first step bravely. If you don't have the courage to take the first step, you can't get achievements. It was meaningful for me to challenge myself while I was in college under the protection of the university. My practical ability has also improved. Although we have improved our theoretical knowledge in class, it is useless if we do not practice. My social horizons have also been broadened. The school's vision is limited, only practice outside the school can broaden our vision. Not everyone likes their major, and not everyone wants to get a job in their major field in the future. In the process of looking for a part-time job or doing a part-time job, we will find what we are really interested in. For example, media, copywriting, video editing, and freelancing, all these jobs are considered "not serious" in the eyes of your family, but as long as you are interested, you will have enough motivation to learn and realize self-worth in the field you love, and the part-time job in college will become your main lucrative career in the future. Success and failure are not the measure of pros and cons. In the part-time job process, college students can precipitate themselves, increase experience, improve ideas, and improve personality. Secondly, part-time job and study complement each other as a whole, which is one of the means for college students to improve their knowledge structure. There is no denying that part-time jobs will occupy college students' time in school, but theoretical knowledge and practice, time and energy are two pairs of unified subjects that need reasonable distribution and coordination. Part-time jobs allow you to use limited time and energy to maximize the effect of time.
